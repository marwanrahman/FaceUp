What it does

FaceUp is an android app developed to connect with the Vuzix Blade wearable smart display and utilize facial recognition technology for a multitude of impact applications in a wide range of fields. By connecting to the Vuzix Blade's wearable camera, the software detects distinct features present in a person's face, and compares those features to a stored library of faces to detect who the person that is present in the shot is. Currently, the app hosts a small collection of faces and is able to distinguish between three different faces by comparing them to stored images. Although simple, the implementation of facial recognition technology in a small, compact, and wearable device unleashes the potential for key impacts that can significantly change the way people approach certain tasks in enterprise, security, exclusive events, emergency and critical conditions, medical, and many more environments. Furthermore, some examples of potential uses include recognizing family and friends for dementia patients and blind individuals, recognizing registered individuals at large events, being alerted of persons of interest in security situations such as an airport or a border crossing, patient profiles for doctors, and much more. As facial recognition technology begins to progress further, the potential for its applications with wearable technology will only grow larger and create more impactful changes.
